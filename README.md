Welcome to my **LeetCode Solutions Repository**! 💻  
Here I practice solving coding problems **across different topics**, focusing on **patterns and problem-solving skills**, and share my solutions in **Java**.  

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

```pgsql
leetcode/
├── Arrays/ # Array problems (Easy / Medium / Hard)
├── LinkedLists/ # Linked List problems
├── StackQueue/ # Stack & Queue problems
├── Recursion/ # Recursion & Backtracking problems
├── Trees/ # Binary Trees, BST, etc.
├── DP/ # Dynamic Programming problems
└── README.md # This file
```

> Each topic folder contains **subfolders by difficulty** (Easy / Medium / Hard) and **well-documented Java solutions**.

## 💡 How I Solve Problems

For each problem, I include:  
- **Problem Name & Number** 📝  
- **LeetCode Link** 🔗  
- **Difficulty Level** 🎯  
- **Approach / Algorithm Explanation** 💡  
- **Time & Space Complexity** ⏱️  
- **Java Implementation** 💻

Example:

```java
// Problem: Two Sum (Easy)
// LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
// Approach: Use HashMap to store seen values
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(n)
```

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Solve problems **mixing topics and difficulty levels**, not just one topic at a time
- Focus on patterns, not total number of problems
- Build a **daily coding habit** 📅
- Document **patterns and approaches for reference**

---

## 🚀 Start Here

- Pick any topic and difficulty to start solving problems.
- Focus on **representative problems for key patterns first** (e.g., Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Recursion).
- Rotate topics regularly to **keep learning diverse patterns.**

---

## ✨ Notes

- Each solution is **self-contained and ready to run.**
- Shields and emojis make it **visual and easy to navigate.**
- Contributions and discussions are welcome! 💛
