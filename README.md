## 💡 How I Solve Problems

For each problem, I include:  
- **Problem Name & Number** 📝  
- **LeetCode Link** 🔗  
- **Difficulty Level** 🎯  
- **Approach / Algorithm Explanation** 💡  
- **Time & Space Complexity** ⏱️  
- **Java Implementation** 💻

Example:

```java
// Problem: Two Sum (Easy)
// LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
// Approach: Use HashMap to store seen values
// Time Complexity: O(n)
// Space Complexity: O(n)
```

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Solve problems **topic by topic**: Easy → Medium → Hard
- Build a **daily coding habit** 📅
- Document **patterns and approaches for reference**

---

## 🚀 Start Here

Begin with the [`Arrays folder`](Arrays/)
 📁, where I solve all array-related problems first.
Each topic has **subfolders by difficulty** (Easy / Medium / Hard) and **well-documented Java solutions**.

---

## ✨ Notes

- Each solution is **self-contained and ready to run.**
- Shields and emojis make it **visual and easy to navigate.**
- Contributions and discussions are welcome! 💛
