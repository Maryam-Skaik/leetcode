Welcome to the **Dynamic Programming section** of my LeetCode Practice Repository! 💻  
Here I focus on **learning and practicing DP patterns**, solving problems step by step, and documenting solutions in **Java**.

## 📂 Folder Structure

```text
DP/
├── Tutorials/         # Exercises and code from DP tutorials (e.g., videos)
├── Easy/              # Easy DP problems from LeetCode
├── Medium/            # Medium DP problems from LeetCode
├── Hard/              # Hard DP problems from LeetCode
└── Patterns.md        # Notes about DP patterns, states, recurrence, and tips
```

> Each problem folder contains well-documented Java solutions including **problem name, link, difficulty, approach, and complexity analysis.**

## 💡 How I Learn DP

1.** Watch/Read Tutorials** (Top-down introduction, memoization, tabulation) 
2. **Solve Example Problems by Hand** to understand the recurrence and base cases
3. **Implement in Java**
  - Start with **recursive + memoization**
  - Then implement **iterative tabulation**
4. **Add explanations:**
  - Recurrence formula
  - Time & space complexity
  - Observed patterns (saved in `Patterns.md`)
5. Commit weekly: track progress and update patterns

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Master **1D, 2D, Knapsack, Grid, and String DP patterns**
- Learn to **recognize patterns across problems**
- Build a **daily coding habit** with consistent practice
- Keep a **public record of learning** to motivate consistency and review patterns

---

## 🚀 Start Here

1. Begin with **Tutorials/** folder: implement exercises from the video
2. Move to **Easy/ → Medium/ → Hard/** problems from LeetCode
3. Track DP patterns and states in `Patterns.md`
4. Rotate problems by type: 1D → 2D → Knapsack → Grid → String → Hard
5. Revisit and refactor code to improve clarity and efficiency

---

> **Tip:** Focus on **patterns and approach** rather than just solving many problems. Keep the learning incremental and consistent.
