# 📅 Daily Challenges

This folder contains my **LeetCode Daily Challenges**, solved one problem per day.  
Each file is named with the **date and problem name**, and contains a **Java solution with test cases**.  

---

## ✅ How I Solve Daily Challenges

1. Read the **problem statement carefully**.  
2. Think of **patterns / optimal approach**.  
3. Implement the solution in **Java**, with **header comments** (problem link, pattern, time & space complexity).  
4. Test with **examples given in the problem**.  
5. Push to **GitHub DailyChallenges folder**.

## 📌 Notes

- Problems are **solved in order of the daily challenge** posted by LeetCode.  
- Each solution is **self-contained and ready to run**.  
- This helps **track streaks, patterns, and progress**.
